Some notes:
- In the commit history, there are commits named after the best checkpoints. The code in that commit is what I used to train the model, but it's not the config file! This is because during the training process, I opened another terminal window to experiment with a few things, so the config file changed and I didn't revert it back to the original. The original configs are saved in my notes, not in the commit files.
